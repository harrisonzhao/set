How server sends the board:

G~FLAG~BOARD~SCORES

eg...

G~Y~1 20 32 22 23 2 6 7 9 3 70 72~9 6

FLAG:
	Y: Someone got a set scores need updating
	N: Someone failed a set scores need updating
	F: Game is over, do game over behavior
	B: Board state, no changes to scores

BOARD:
	Board separated by " "
	Order doesn't matter, you can display it however you want

Score:
	In order of playerId, separated by space
	(thus each client instance needs to know whether its playerId 0,1 etc...)
