High priority (Necessary or prevent us from testing other features):
-Implement scoring

Medium priority (Need to be fixed or added):
-When chat fills up, it makes the box bigger and chat becomes unusable. Need it to scroll 
	- I just fixed it for lobby
-Implement some kind of game status reports with each board/score change
 - this is being implemented, but it doesn't change color...working on reformatting text area
-Gameroom exit doesn't return to lobby
 - I need to coordinate with Alejandro on this

Low priority (We should probably fix or add):
-When players enter the room chat only displays (FIRSTPLAYER) has entered
-Cancel button on create game doesn't actually cancel. Just triggers ok to do nothing.
-Display player ratings somewhere
